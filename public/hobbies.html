<h1>Two Things I Enjoy</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Avid Gamer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I love to feel immersed into a rich story and unique world in my free time as an escape from our day-to-day reality and modern social issues. 
            I feel it gives me time to recalibrate and breathe. I also enjoy listening to the "Kinda-Funny Games Daily" podcasts as a daily source for video game news.
        </li>
    </ul>
<h2>PC Enthusiast</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I love PC building. I have a strong interest in computer hardware and making it all come together for a working machine. I am experienced in assembling, configuring, and maintaining custom-built computer systems.
