    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I’m a Corporate Field IT Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and supporting teams at every level—from front-line users and Microsoft Teams-enabled training rooms to C-suite executives and boardroom technology during quarterly meetings. My experience spans the IT spectrum, including full-stack web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), enterprise networking, and infrastructure troubleshooting—from individual device settings to rack-level work in data centers and IDF closets.</p>
        <p>I work daily with Microsoft Azure tools such as Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) for identity and access management, and Intune for cloud-based endpoint management. I also utilize the Microsoft Teams Admin Center—a separate web portal used to manage Teams settings, policies, and features—and Secret Server, a Privileged Access Management solution that secures sensitive credentials like passwords and API keys in an encrypted centralized vault.</p>
        <p>I’m driven by the opportunity to leverage technology to streamline operations, test and deploy emerging equipment, and keep our enterprise environment aligned with cutting-edge innovation.</p>
